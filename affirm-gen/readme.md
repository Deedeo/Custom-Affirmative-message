# **Affirmations Generator**

### Today's focus is using all the skills you have learned so far:

* input and output
* concatenation
* if statements
* nested if statements
* Build a custom affirmations generator to give the user a customized affirmation each day of the week.

``Make sure you ask the user for their name, the current day of the week, and a few of their favorite things. All of this information should be used to help you build your affirmations.
The goal is to generate a unique message for each day of the week based on the user's answers.
Use concatenation to generate the affirmation.``


``**Final challenge: Can you create if statements that do not care about capital or lowercase letters of names.
